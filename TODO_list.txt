TODO list

1. write the API
    (DONE) - determine URL for each GET and POST
    (DONE - error codes) - don't forget to send back some message to frontend
                           to tell them the backend actually saved the new data
                           from a POST request.
    (DONE - error codes) - Make system that will deal with cases such as
                         - the POST request did not give valid data
                         - the POST request is missing data
                         - the GET request could not find what frontend wanted
                         - etc.

2. Make methods that will give the right JSON to frontend
    (DONE - changed to getting them by GET & POST as joining the JSONs
    caused serialization problems. the is_valid() kept returning False
    and I don't know how to fix it.) - join advertisement with all it's
    accommodation reviews, events.
