TO DO list

1. write the API
    (DONE) - determine URL for each GET and POST
    (DONE - error codes) - don't forget to send back some message to frontend
                           to tell them the backend actually saved the new data
                           from a POST request.
    (DONE - error codes) - Make system that will deal with cases such as
                         - the POST request did not give valid data
                         - the POST request is missing data
                         - the GET request could not find what frontend wanted
                         - etc.

2. Make methods that will give the right JSON to frontend
    (DONE - changed to getting them by GET & POST as joining the JSONs
    caused serialization problems. the is_valid() kept returning False
    and I don't know how to fix it.) - join advertisement with all it's
    accommodation reviews, events.

3. (DONE) Make methods that will write the given JSON to database

4. [Backend] write methods for searches for the search module

5. (DONE) - get events for an ad - [Backend] booking module: give frontend the
    dates and time for each event

6. (DONE) - the model method "check_overlap" should take care of this but probably
    need to write a method to tell frontend part from a 401 message. -
    [Backend] booking request module: check the advertisement's events

7. (DONE) - [Backend] allow user to decline, accept, cancel booking requests

8. [Backend] email communication between users

1. user profile needs a list_of_rentals (event_id) —> the places you are renting, have rented
2. user profile need a list of posted_reviews (rev_id) —> the reviews that you wrote for a rented place

(DONE) - /get/2018-10-10/2018-10-18/null/2/50/100.50/3/ --> not giving location,
            ==> no location search, no decimal search
(DONE) - {backend} need to work out how to pattern match the SEARCH URL given by frontend

TODO
- {frontend} when creating a review, backend needs: --> URL: 'post/review/create/'
            1. the email of the reviewer, which is the current person logged in --> data['user']['email']
            2. ad_owner, email of ad owner --> data['body']['ad_owner']
            3. ad_id, id of ad --> data['body']['ad_id']

            when updating a review, backend needs: --> URL: 'post/review/update/'
            1. rev_id, review id --> data['body']['rev_id']
            2. ad_id, ad id --> data['body']['ad_id']
            3. ad_owner, email of owner --> data['body']['ad_owner']
            4. the email of the reviewer, which is the current person logged in --> data['user']['email']

            when deleting a review, backend needs: --> URL: 'post/review/delete/'
            1. rev_id, review id --> data['body']['rev_id']
            2. ad_id, ad id --> data['body']['ad_id']
            3. ad_owner, email of owner --> data['body']['ad_owner']
            4. the email of the reviewer, which is the current person logged in --> data['user']['email']

            when getting all the reviews for a single ad, backend needs: --> URL: 'get/review/user/'
            1. ad_owner, email of ad owner --> data['body']['ad_owner']
            2. ad_id, id of ad --> data['body']['ad_id']

- {both ends} make & check request module works (dumb feature) for update

- {are we allowing the deletion of events???} only delete event if the status is booked, don't allow delete if status is finished
