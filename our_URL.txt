API URLs

How to read:
- If something is wrapped in <> angle brackets, it means that part of the URL
  changes.
- first refers to the part of the email before the @ sign
- second refers to the part of the email after the @ sign
    - e.g. bears@gmail.com
    - first = bears
    - second = gmail
    - NOTE: whenever there are none alphabet letters it doesn't work
    - the view methods will reconstruct the email:
        - email = first + "@" + second + ".com"
